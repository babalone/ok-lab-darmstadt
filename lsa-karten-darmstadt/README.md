## How to build and run?
* Install dart (project started with 2.9.0)
* activate and configure webdev and stagehand
* run `webdev serve`

## Development diary
* installed and then wrote "how to build and run?" in the this README.md
* write this while waiting for webdev to complete, example app (looks like a TODO-app) seems to work
* removed example and created new `stagehand web-simple`
* added dartleaf ^0.1.5, added the minimal required code in main.dart, added leaflet to the index.html, set heigth of the map-div to 100%
* will commit now as first milestone (getting a map loaded in the browser) is achieved
